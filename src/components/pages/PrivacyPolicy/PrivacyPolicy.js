                        <p className="app-txt --margin">The The Coder website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A
                            cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be
                            used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
                            and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. </p>
                        <p className="app-txt --margin">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
                            purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                            example, if you personalize The Coder pages, or register with The Coder site or services, a cookie
                            helps The Coder to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
                            of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
                            When you return to the same The Coder website, the information you previously provided can be
                            retrieved, so you can easily use the The Coder features that you customized.

                            cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
                            choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
